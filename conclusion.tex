In this paper we have given a new, deterministic algorithm for computing
the Hermite normal form of a nonsingular matrix polynomial. Our method
relied on the efficient, deterministic computation of the diagonal
elements of the Hermite form. As a corollary we also obtain a fast,
deterministic algorithm for finding the determinant of a matrix of
polynomials.
